# Quantum Fluid Spacetime Theory (QFST)

## Overview
This repository contains the full code, data, and plots supporting the Quantum Fluid Spacetime Theory (QFST), a novel quantum gravity framework explaining galactic rotation curves without dark matter particles.

## Contents
- `qfst_diagnostics.py`: Main diagnostics and cross-validation script.
- `qfst_vortex.py` and `qfst_vortex_sim.py`: Core quantum vortex and simulation modules.
- Data files (`.csv`) for galaxy fits and residuals.
- Plot directories with publication-ready figures.
- Supporting notebooks and supplemental material.
- Code for gravitational wave dispersion predictions.

## Getting Started
To reproduce the results:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ak-jaat-007/QuantumFluidSpacetimeTheory-QFST.git
   cd QuantumFluidSpacetimeTheory-QFST
Install dependencies (recommend using a virtual environment):

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the diagnostics script:

bash
python qfst_diagnostics.py
Results
Galaxy rotation curves fitted for dwarfs, spirals, ellipticals.

Cross-validation and statistical comparison of QFST vs Î›CDM and NFW.

Plots for publication including chi-square boxplots, gravitational wave dispersion predictions.

Identification of outlier galaxies in rotation curve fits.
